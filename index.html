                <h3>Fairy tale</h3>
                <p>My Name is Galganek and in Polish slang it means a cloud. 
                In human word there is no such name so I use it as my surname. My fisrt name in Yaga. 
                I was born on a cloud. Pink and fluffy. 
                One day, out of blue (hehe - pun not intended) I was accidentally kidnapped by Stork, William.
                His job was to deliver babies, but that day he got lost. He nicked me from the sky and I become a human girl.
                I lived in tiny house, called the Nutshell. One day I met Saint Herman Fro and he banished me to The Dark Forest.
                Although I wasn't alone there. I had two friends beside me. All of them were plush toys, who could talk. 
                First was elephant-shaped pillow, called Theo; second was flower patterned seal - Foka Hoka.
